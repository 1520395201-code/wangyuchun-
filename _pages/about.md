My name is Yuchun Wang. I completed my undergraduate studies at Nanjing Agricultural University and earned my master's degree from Nanjing University. My academic journey has fueled a deep interest in the intersection of population migration and social media. I am particularly fascinated by how online platforms influence migration decisions and how migrant communities utilize digital tools to connect and adapt. I aim to further explore the dynamics within this field, believing it offers critical insights into contemporary societal transformations. I look forward to discussing these compelling topics.
